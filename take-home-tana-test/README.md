# Question 1: Longest Valid String Finder (Java)

This program implements a Java function `getLongestString` that returns the longest valid string from a given list of strings, based on the following rules:

###  Validation Rules
1. No repeated identical adjacent characters (e.g., `"AAB"` is invalid).
2. Only characters from a provided list of allowed characters are permitted.

### ðŸ§ª Example

**Allowed Characters:** `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']`  
**Input Strings:** `"AABCDA"`, `"ABCDZADC"`, `"ABCDBCA"`, `"ABCDABDCA"`  
**Output:** `"ABCDABDCA"`

### ðŸ§° Features
- Simple Java class with `main()` to run test cases
- Includes edge case handling (empty list, all invalid, ties)
- Code is clean, well-commented, and easy to understand

### ðŸ“¦ How to Run
Compile and run the Java file:

```bash
javac Question1_GetLongestString.java
java Question1_GetLongestString
```

# Question 4: First Unique Product (Java)

This Java program finds the **first product** in a list that appears **only once**. If all products are repeated, it returns `null`.

### âœ… Problem Description

Given an array of product names (strings), return the first product that is **non-repeating**.

### ðŸ§ª Example

**Input:** `["Apple", "Computer", "Apple", "Bag"]`  
**Output:** `"Computer"`

**Input:** `["Pen", "Pen", "Book", "Book"]`  
**Output:** `null`

### ðŸ§  Approach

- Uses a `LinkedHashMap` to count frequencies while maintaining insertion order.
- Iterates to find the first entry with count `1`.

### ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
javac Question4_UniqueProductPicker.java
java Question4_UniqueProductPicker
```
# Question 5: nearest minimun gap

This Java program finds the **minimum distance** between any two occurrences of the **smallest value** in a given array of integers.

### âœ… Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` integers. Find the **distance between the two closest minimum values** in the array.

**Constraints:**
- The minimum value is guaranteed to appear **at least twice**.

### ðŸ§ª Example

**Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`  
**Output:** `3`  
Explanation: The smallest value is `1`, which appears at indices 0 and 3 â†’ distance = `3 - 0 = 3`.

**Input:** `[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4]`  
**Output:** `2`  
Explanation: The smallest value is `4`, which appears at indices 5 and 7 â†’ distance = `2`.

### ðŸ§  Approach

- Find the **minimum value** in the array.
- Track the **indices** of all occurrences of that value.
- Compute the **smallest difference** between any two consecutive indices.

### ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
javac Question5_NearestMinGap.java
java Question5_NearestMinGap
```
# Question 6: Top 3 Most Common Words in a Sentence

This Java program takes a sentence and returns the **three most common words** sorted **alphabetically**.

### Example
**Input:**  
"hi there care to discuss algorithm basis or how to solve algorithm or"

**Output:**  
`["algorithm", "or", "to"]`

### How It Works
1. Splits the sentence into words.
2. Counts word frequencies.
3. Uses a priority queue to sort by frequency and alphabet.
4. Returns the top 3, sorted alphabetically.

### Run
```bash
javac Question6_TopThreeWordsFinder.java
java Question6_TopThreeWordsFinder
```
# Question 7: Rotate Linked List Right by N

This Java program rotates a singly linked list to the right by `n` positions.

### Example
Input:  
`ID_A01 -> ID_A02 -> ID_A03 -> ID_A04 -> ID_A05 -> ID_A06 -> null`, `n = 2`

Output:  
`ID_A05 -> ID_A06 -> ID_A01 -> ID_A02 -> ID_A03 -> ID_A04 -> null`

### How It Works
1. Measure the list length.
2. Connect tail to head (make circular).
3. Break the circle at the right spot to form the rotated list.

### Run
```bash
javac Question7_LinkedListRotator.java
java Question7_LinkedListRotator
```
